README.txt for Html to Text
===========================

This is a Drupal 7 custom module that converts HTML/XHTML to formatted
text.

It is also a simple demonstration of how a Drupal 7 module may
interact with the form API.


Installation
------------

1. Clone the repo to a local directory and move all the files in into
   a directory named html2txt in your modules directory (this is
   usually sites/all/modules).
2. Enable Html to Text from admin/modules.
4. The module is now ready for use.


Usage
-----

After installation, there will be a menu entry HTML to text in the
navigation menu.  It will take you to form with a large textarea.
Paste HTML into the form and click Submit.  Formatted text will
appear in the form and can be copied from there.
